# Example_code

This repository is intended to be a showcase and will contain code that I've written on 3 different topics: Metropolis algorithm, genetic algorithms and machine learning.

Each directory contains a Jupyter Notebook file which collects the description of the code, the theoretical introduction, some comments about the scripts and the main results. All the scripts have been written by me, while the introductory and theoretical parts of the Jupyter Notebook files have been taken from the lessons of Professor Davide E. Galli of University of Milan.
